          <h3>DEC 2021 | ADACADABRAS</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>#MeToo</strong>. Two words, a hashtag, a civil rights movement with tremendous impacts on our
            society. Everything starts on October 15<sup>th</sup>, 2017, with a viral Twitter hashtag from Alyssa
            Milano. The movement, initially created by Tarana Burke, spread all over the world, inviting women to break
            silence on sexual harassment, violence, discrimination via social networks. The medias stepped in with
            widespread coverage and enhanced the movement's influence. Finally, women inequalities and the unsafe
            climate created by actors of society became a trending and polarizing topic on all media. Still, the
            question of the size of MeToo's impact on women's discrimination is to be answered. Via the metric of
            women's mediatic coverage, our project aims at assessing and quantifying the impact of #MeToo on the place
            of women in society. By using Quotebank
            <sup><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">
                [1]
              </a></sup> dataset from 2015 to 2020, we will investigate the evolution of
            women’s mediatization through time and correlate it to #MeToo's key turning points.

          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            The MeToo movement does not exist without social media, especially Twitter. Ever since october 2017, women
            from various parts of the world started breaking their silence about past misconducts they suffered, trying
            to hold personnalities accountable (mostly male politicians and entertainment celebrities). The movement
            transcended virtual spaces and went to the streets. Women are not objects, and sexual harrasment should be
            talked about. The activists' goals are simple. Not only should the past be dug up, but one should not be
            afraid to speak up and fight for what is right.
          </p>

          <h3>
            Women speak much less than men.
          </h3>
          <p>
            After a first look at the data, we can see that the percentage of women speakers in the whole dataset varies
            between 15 and 20%. We also see that starting from late 2017, the percentage starts going up slightly, which
            coincides with the first Metoo tweet. We deduce then that MeToo gave more place to women in media, and our
            study is done...
          </p>

          <p>
            It is of course not that simple, and even though the rise in percentages is significant, we cannot draw any
            conclusions this early yet.

            Ok! but what do these men have so much to talk about?
          </h3>
          <p>
            In order to find out, we trained a machine learning model with data coming from social media, namely Reddit,
            and tried to see how accurately this model can classify a sentence as mysoginistic or not. When testing it
            on Quotebank's subdatasets (Talking about women or metoo), we get a very low ratio of mysoginistic quotes to
            total quotes for both, with a slightly higher ratio when metoo is the subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            What we had actually created was a detector of extremely sexist and rude quotes, since a couple of months
            would not be enough for us to perfect the model and make it detect subtle sexism, as this can be a project
            by itself.
          </p>
          <h3>Running a sentiment analysis...</h3>
          <p>
            Analysing the variation of sentiment for different categories may lead to understanding the reaction the
            certain groups of people to the metoo movement, and how the overall sentiment around women changed. The
            sentiment analysis was run on both subdatasets, and we separated quotes by the speakers' gender and age. We
            also extracted the average sentiment around 2 key dates in the movement, the 15<sup>th</sup> of October
            (Date of initial tweet) and the 8<sup>th</sup> of March (women’s day).

          <h3>
            What words appear the most in the quotes?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Showed below are 3 wordclouds generated in the subdataset where the subject revolves around women.
          </p>
          <p>
            Firstly, 2015, when MeToo did not exist yet. The main words we see are related to family, and "sexual
            assault" and "domestic violence" appear in small.
          </p>
          <div align='middle'><img src="assets/img/2015_12.png" alt="Pre wordcloud"></div>
          <p>
            Then, 2017, the year the movement was created. We see new terms appearing (e.g. "sexual harrassment",
            "sexual misconnduct"...). It is expected for such words and bigrams to blow up since we are at the peak at
            the movement and any other result would have been unexpected.
          </p>
          <div align='middle'><img src="assets/img/2017_11.png" alt="During wordcloud"></div>
          <p>
            Finally, 2019, when the movement is supposed to be past its peak. The main words we see go back
            family-related ones, but now keywords related to MeToo are more existent than in 2015. It is a great result
            to see, because even though the main subject around women is back to where it was, we can see some influence
            that the movement had on the content of the quotes after 2017.

            <h5>Quotebank dataset</h5>

            <p>
              The data explored in this story comes from the
              <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/people/west/pub/Vaucher-Spitz-Catasta-West_WSDM-21.pdf"
                target="_blank">Quotebank
                dataset</a>.
              This dataset represents a collection of 178 million quotations from various English speaking news
              articles. Every quote has then been sanitized and analyzed by a machine learning model named Quobert,
              based on the NLP model BERT
              <sup><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="">
                  [2]
                </a></sup>, developed by Google. Quotebank contains probabilities of potential speakers for each quote
              that was captured from 2008 to 2020.
              It is publicly available
              <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4277311" target="_blank">here</a>.
            </p>

            <h5>Data Exclusion Rules</h5>

            <p>
              Data included in this story may differ slightly from other published reports due to certain data
              decisions. For the purposes of these analyses, the Quotebank dataset has been manipulated as follows:
            </p>
            <p>
              1. The whole speaker-attributed dataset from 2008 to 2020 has size around 32.8 GB. This would be too much
              to handle to create a datastory at our scale. Also, the MeToo movement does not happen until the latter
              part of the 2010's, which means it would be a waste of memory and time to use all data since 2008.
            </p>
            <p>
              2. Since Quotebank assigns to a single quote different speakers with different degrees of certainty, the
              speaker with the highest probability is kept for the datastory, and the other speakers are discarded.
            </p>
            <p>
              3. Quotebank sometimes attributes certain quotes to an "Unknown" speaker. The quote is discarded if
              "Unknown" is the only possibility. If there are multiple choices, the most certain <b>known</b> speaker is
              kept and the rest are discared.
            </p>
            <p>
              4. A large filtering of the quotes has been done. Since the story revolves around MeToo and the place of
              women in media, 2 subdatasets have been created with keywords-based filtering: <li> A subdataset
                representing quotes where women are mentioned or talked about.</li>
              <li>Another much smaller subdataset
                where only MeToo-related keywords were fed in order to obtain much more representative quotes towards
                the
                movement.</li>
            </p>
